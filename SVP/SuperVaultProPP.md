**Effective Date:** July 23, 2025

### The Core Principle: Zero Data Collection

We believe that your data is yours and yours alone. Our app is built on the fundamental principle of collecting **absolutely no personal information or data**.

To be perfectly clear, **we do not collect, store, view, or transmit**:
* Your photos, videos, or any other files you store in the vault.
* Your passwords, login credentials, or Browse history.
* Your contacts, notes, or any text you enter.
* Personal information of any kind, such as your name, email address, or location.
* App usage data, analytics, crash reports, or performance metrics.
* Unique device identifiers or any other information about your device.

Everything you do within Ultra Vault stays on your device. Period.

### How Your Data is Handled

All features within the app are designed to be completely offline and local to your device.

* **Photos, Videos & Secure Files**: Any files you import are **stored only on your device's local, secure storage**. They are never uploaded to any server and are completely inaccessible to us.
* **Password Manager**: The login credentials and passwords you save are stored securely within the app's local database on your device.
* **Secure Browser**: Your Browse history, bookmarks, and any data from your web sessions are kept locally and are erased or stored according to your in-app settings. We do not track your activity.
* **Contacts & Notes**: The contacts and notes you create or import exist only within the app on your device.
* **Security PIN & Biometrics**: Your PIN code is stored securely in your device's Keychain. It is used only for unlocking the app locally. If you enable Face ID or Touch ID, the app uses Apple's secure biometric authentication framework, and we never have access to your biometric data.
